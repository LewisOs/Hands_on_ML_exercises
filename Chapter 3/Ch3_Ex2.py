Write a function that can shift an MNIST image in any direction (left, right, 
up, down), but 1 pixel. Then, for each image in the training set, create four 
shifted copies (one per direction) and add them to the training set. Finally, 
train your best model on this expanded training set and measure its accuracy 
on the test set. This technique of artificially growing or expanding the 
training set is called data augmentation or training set expansion.
